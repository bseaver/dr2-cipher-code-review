# Cipher

## Epicodus Drupal Week 2 Code Review - Create a Drupal Custom Module

#### Demonstrate Custom Module Programming Technique with Forms, Validation and PHP coding

### Requires previous installation of:
  * Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/) to host the Website and MySQL Database

### Utilizes:
  * Drupal 7.54 (https://www.drupal.org/)

### Key Requirements:
  * 3 validated text input fields:
    * Field 1 (Shift): allows "1" - "26"
    * Field 2 (Direction): allows "left" or "right"
    * Field 3 (Phrase): allows only English letters, spaces and punctuation
  * Submitted phrase is encoded using (Caesar cipher)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher] except instead of result being all in UPPERCASE it is in lowercase

### Project Plan:
  * Follow steps (see below) to create a new Drupal project on a Mac
  * Create an About page explaining about the cipher and how to use it
  * Iteratively create a cipher custom module in sites/all/modules/custom
  * Since time allows, extend features beyond the `Key Functional Requirements`:
    * Support decryption
    * Support defaulting of random direction

### Installation Notes From GitHub:
  * git clone this repo on your desktop
  * This cloned folder is the `project` or `site` folder
  * The folder may be renamed at this point to your preference or convenience
  * Database, database user, site administrator and all passwords are `cipher`
  * Site database is stored in sites/db-backup/ and needs to be imported into MAMP by opening `localhost:8888/phpmyadmin/`
  * You may need to recreate in MAMP SQL the `cipher` administrator database user and password
  * Set MAMP's Host Document Root folder to site folder, restart servers
  * Launch site by opening `localhost:8888/`

### Summary of Steps Used to Create a Drupal Site:
* Copy downloaded Drupal core to the Desktop (for convenience)
* Rename the Drupal core folder to indicate the name of the project
* The following commands apply from the root of the project folder:
* Rename (to effectively remove) .gitignore
* The following may be needed in access controlled environments:
  * $ `chmod -R a+w sites/default`
  * Copy `project/sites/default/default.settings.php` to `project/sites/default/settings.php`
* Set MAMP's Host Document Root folder to project folder, restart servers
* Open SQL page `localhost:8888/phpmyadmin/`
* Create database with collation `utf8_general_ci`
* Create admin user for Drupal site's internal use
* Open `localhost:8888/` for new Drupal site
* Setup: Standard, English, Database, host and port 127.0.0.1 and 8889
* Initial Site name, email, admin user, country, time zone and turn off e-mail notices for demonstration purposes
* Verify initial site is working
* Create a README.md file in the project root
* Commit the README.md
* Commit initial Drupal files and database backup
* Iteratively, add features to site and commit

### Incremental and Final Save of Site Database
* Export MAMP hosted database specifying:
  * Custom, SQL, All Tables (structure and data)
  * Save output to File, Compression: zipped
  * Add option: create database
  * Add option: drop table
* Save zip file to sites/db-backup/ (replacing previous copy if any)
* Add and Commit this file to the git repository
